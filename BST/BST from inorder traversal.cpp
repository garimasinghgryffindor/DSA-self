not possible to get the exact bst from which the inorder was created
inorder is always in ascending order

so inorder for trees like

1.      1
          \
            2 
              \
                3
                  \
                    4
                      \
                        5
                        
  
2.          3
          /   \
         2     4
        /       \
       1         5
  
  
etc will be same
